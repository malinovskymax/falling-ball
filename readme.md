It's a ball that bounces accordingly to (almost) real-life physics or parameters of your choise.

The main parameter of the ball's bouncing is a speed conservation coefficient.

Consider falling ball, that touches the floor.

When falling ball touches the surface in real life, the ball is being a little deformed respectively its elasticity and other parameters.
The surface on which it has fallen, is also being a little deformed.
Part of the kinetic energy of the ball would be transformed into heat.
Some kinetic energy will be spent on creating waves of pressure in surrounding matter (sound
electromagnetic and gravitational waves. At some point the ball and surrounding matter will partially
recover their shapes and as a result the ball will bounce. This process in real life is almost unstoppable
until some Planck time, Planck distance and Planck energy quantum effects make the ball actuall stop
moving.

Instead of doing this over-complicated calculations (which requires a supercomputer),
I use a single coefficient that defines how much speed that the ball has gained while
falling is preserved when the ball is debouncing.
If that initial debounce speed allows the ball to jump higher than 1px under condition of free fall
acceleration pressing the ball to the surface - it will debounce. Otherwice it will stop.
